# CodeWars Practice - Prompt Collection

This document contains ready-to-use prompts for different phases of your CodeWars practice workflow. Copy and paste these when working with AI assistants.

**Important**: Always start by sharing the `project-context.md` file with the AI assistant or reference it in your prompt to ensure the AI understands your project structure, purpose, and templates.

## Initial Project Setup Prompt

```
I need help setting up my CodeWars practice project. I've created a project context document that explains my project structure and workflow:

[PASTE CONTENTS OF project-context.md HERE]

Based on this context, please help me:

1. Create the necessary directory structure:
   - Main CODEWARS folder
   - Subfolders for JavaScript and Python
   - Kyu level folders (8kyu, 7kyu, 6kyu) inside each language folder

2. Move my existing solutions to the appropriate folders
3. Create the template files for my project
4. Set up any additional organization that would be helpful

My current project structure looks like: [describe your current setup]
```

## Challenge Selection Prompt

```
I'm continuing my CodeWars practice project as described in context.md:

Help me select a random [difficulty level] CodeWars challenge for [language].

For example, find me a random 8kyu JavaScript challenge that would help me practice [specific concept, e.g., array manipulation, string methods, etc.].

Once you find a suitable challenge, please:
1. Format it according to my project template as shown in the context
2. Create a new file for it in the appropriate folder
```

## Solution Development Prompt

```
I'm working on my CodeWars practice project. Here's the context for how my project is structured:

[PASTE CONTENTS OF project-context.md HERE]

I'm working on this CodeWars challenge:

[Paste problem description]

This is in my [language] [kyu level] folder.

1. Help me think through an initial approach
2. Guide me in implementing a working solution
3. Most importantly, explain WHY this solution works - what concepts does it use and what should I learn from it?
4. Suggest alternative approaches if relevant

Please follow my project template format as shown in the context for consistency.
```

## Concept Exploration Prompt

```
I'm working on my CodeWars practice project with this structure and purpose:

[PASTE CONTENTS OF project-context.md HERE]

I've solved this CodeWars challenge:

[Paste your solution]

But I don't fully understand [specific concept or part of solution].

Can you explain:
1. Why this works
2. The underlying programming concepts
3. How I could apply this to other problems
4. Any edge cases I should be aware of

I'm trying to build a deeper understanding beyond just making the solution work, as explained in my project context.
```

## Code Review Prompt

```
I'm following my CodeWars practice project methodology:

[PASTE CONTENTS OF project-context.md HERE]

I've completed this CodeWars solution:

[Paste your solution with template sections]

Can you review it and help me improve:
1. Code efficiency (time/space complexity)
2. Code readability
3. The completeness of my explanation
4. Any edge cases I might have missed
5. Alternative approaches I could have used

I want to make sure I'm learning as much as possible from each challenge, following the learning objectives in my project context.
```

## Project Analysis Prompt

```
I've been working on my CodeWars practice project for [time period]. Here's how my project is structured:

[PASTE CONTENTS OF project-context.md HERE]

Can you help me analyze my progress?

Here are examples of problems I've solved: [provide a few examples]

1. What concepts am I getting good practice with?
2. What areas might I be missing?
3. What should I focus on next to improve?
4. Based on my solutions, what patterns in my coding approach do you notice?

I want to make sure my practice is comprehensive and effective according to the learning objectives in my project context.
```

## Automation Ideas Prompt

```
I'd like to add some automation to my CodeWars practice project. Here's the context of my project:

[PASTE CONTENTS OF project-context.md HERE]

Specifically, I'm interested in:

1. Automatically pulling random challenges from CodeWars API
2. Tracking my progress over time
3. Analyzing patterns in the types of problems I've solved
4. [Other automation ideas]

Can you help me design and implement these features while maintaining consistency with my project structure and learning objectives?
