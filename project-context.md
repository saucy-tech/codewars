# CodeWars Practice - Project Context

This document explains how this CodeWars practice project is organized and how it works. Share this with AI assistants to provide context for your workflow.

## Project Overview
This is a systematic approach to practicing coding challenges from CodeWars, emphasizing not just solving problems but understanding the underlying concepts and patterns.

## Directory Structure
```
/CODEWARS
  /JavaScript
    /8kyu
      challenge-name.js
    /7kyu
      challenge-name.js
    /6kyu
      challenge-name.js
  /Python
    /8kyu
      challenge-name.py
    ...
  setup-plan.md
  project-context.md (this file)
  prompts.md
```

## File Format
Each solution file follows this template structure:

```javascript
/**
 * CodeWars Challenge: [Challenge Name]
 * Difficulty: [kyu level]
 * 
 * PROBLEM:
 * [The complete problem description from CodeWars]
 * 
 * INITIAL THOUGHTS:
 * [Initial approach to solving the problem]
 * 
 * SOLUTION:
 */

function solutionName(params) {
    // Solution implementation
}

/**
 * UNDERSTANDING:
 * [Explanation of why this solution works]
 * [Core concepts being tested]
 * [Key learning points]
 * 
 * NOTES FOR NEXT TIME:
 * [Patterns to remember]
 * [Potential optimizations]
 */
```

## Typical Workflow
1. Select a challenge from CodeWars based on difficulty level
2. Create a new file in the appropriate language/kyu folder
3. Fill in the problem description and initial thoughts
4. Implement a solution with the help of AI when needed
5. Document understanding and learning points
6. Commit and push to GitHub

## Main Learning Objectives
- Build a growing reference library of solutions with explanations
- Focus on understanding WHY solutions work, not just getting them to work
- Identify patterns across similar problems
- Build a foundation of problem-solving approaches
- Track progress through different difficulty levels

## Using AI Effectively
When working with AI assistants on this project:
1. Share this context document
2. Be specific about which stage of the workflow you're in
3. Ask for explanations of concepts, not just code
4. Request alternative approaches to learn different techniques
5. Use the prompts from prompts.md for consistent interactions
