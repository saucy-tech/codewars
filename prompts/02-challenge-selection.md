# Challenge Selection Prompt

I'm continuing my CodeWars practice project as described in @project-context.md:

Help me select a random [difficulty level] CodeWars challenge for [language].

For example, find me a random 8kyu JavaScript challenge that would help me practice [specific concept, e.g., array manipulation, string methods, etc.].

Once you find a suitable challenge, please:

1. Format it according to my project template as shown in the context
2. Create a new file for it in the appropriate folder

Please do not provide any solution hints or approaches - I want to solve this independently.
