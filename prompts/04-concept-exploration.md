# Concept Exploration Prompt

I'm working on my CodeWars practice project with this structure and purpose:

@project-context.md

I've solved this CodeWars challenge:

[Paste your solution]

But I don't fully understand [specific concept or part of solution].

Can you help me explore this concept by:

1. Asking me questions to help me think through why this works
2. Guiding me to discover the underlying programming concepts
3. Helping me identify how this could apply to other problems
4. Leading me to think about potential edge cases

I want to build a deeper understanding through guided exploration rather than direct explanation.
