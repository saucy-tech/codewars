# Solution Development Prompt

I'm working on my CodeWars practice project. Here's the context for how my project is structured:

@project-context.md

I'm working on this CodeWars challenge:

[Paste problem description]

This is in my [language] [kyu level] folder.

I want to solve this independently, so please:

1. Help me break down the problem into smaller steps
2. Ask me guiding questions to help me think through the approach
3. Only provide hints if I'm stuck, and even then, try to lead me to the solution rather than giving it directly
4. Once I have a solution, help me understand the concepts and suggest improvements

Please follow my project template format as shown in the context for consistency.
