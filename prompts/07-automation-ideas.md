# Automation Ideas Prompt

I'd like to add some automation to my CodeWars practice project. Here's the context of my project:

@project-context.md

Specifically, I'm interested in:

1. Automatically pulling random challenges from CodeWars API
2. Tracking my progress over time
3. Analyzing patterns in the types of problems I've solved
4. [Other automation ideas]

Can you help me think through:

1. What specific features would be most valuable for my learning?
2. How can I design this to support independent problem-solving?
3. What metrics would be helpful for tracking my progress?
4. How can I implement these features while maintaining my focus on learning?

I want to create tools that enhance my learning experience without taking away from the challenge of solving problems independently.
