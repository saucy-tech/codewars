# Initial Project Setup Prompt

I need help setting up my CodeWars practice project. I've created a project context document that explains my project structure and workflow:

@project-context.md

Based on this context, please help me:

1. Create the necessary directory structure:

   - Main CODEWARS folder
   - Subfolders for JavaScript and Python
   - Kyu level folders (8kyu, 7kyu, 6kyu) inside each language folder

2. Move my existing solutions to the appropriate folders
3. Create the template files for my project
4. Set up any additional organization that would be helpful

My current project structure looks like: [describe your current setup]
