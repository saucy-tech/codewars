/**
 * CodeWars Challenge: Remove First and Last Character
 * Difficulty: 8kyu
 *
 * PROBLEM:
 * It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string.
 * You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.
 *
 * INITIAL THOUGHTS:
 * We'll need to:
 * 1. Take a string input
 * 2. Remove the first character (index 0)
 * 3. Remove the last character (index length-1)
 * 4. Return the resulting string
 *
 * SOLUTION:
 */

function removeChar(str) {
  // Your solution code
}

/**
 * UNDERSTANDING:
 * This challenge tests:
 * - String manipulation methods
 * - Array-like string operations
 * - Basic string length understanding
 *
 * NOTES FOR NEXT TIME:
 * - Remember that strings in JavaScript are immutable
 * - Consider different string methods that could be used
 * - Think about edge cases (though not required for this problem)
